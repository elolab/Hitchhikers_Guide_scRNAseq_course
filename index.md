## Integration

This site serves as a repository for the [course materials](#course-materials) provided on the second day of the course [The Hitchhiker's Guide to scRNA-seq](https://www.medicina.ulisboa.pt/en/hitchhikers-guide-scrna-seq) (08-12/07/2024, iMM, Lisbon, Portugal), which focuses on the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing data. 

The [course materials](#course-materials) utilize minimalistic, publicly available scRNA-seq datasets to evaluate the performance of various integration methods across three tasks: (1) cross-tissue, (2) biological conditions, and (3) cell lines. The course addresses the challenges of integration, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of different methods applied to these tasks. Additionally, a practical example of reference mapping is demonstrated by classifying and projecting PBMCs from two COVID-19 patients onto a previously annotated PBMC reference

<br>

### Pre-requisites

The course materials are delivered as [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) notebooks which can be reproduced with basic-level knowledge of *R programming* language. The participants may benefit from medium-level knowledge of `R` to explore more in-depth some analyses and familiarity with [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) object and functionality.
